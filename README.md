# Sprint 7 Project
> Jennifer Teh

In this project, I tested get, post, put, and delete requests for Urban Grocers kits.  I tested response status codes and, after modifying files, I again tested response codes.  

I tested using Visual Studio Code.  I also used Postman, API Docs, and Swagger.  As well as a lot of help from TT Tutors (thank you!).

The tests can be found at the following links:

get https://github.com/j-tehus/hm07-qa-us/blob/8bcb5d6c7ecd50e55b54c15c272e9288631eff95/tests/getHandlers.test.js

put  https://github.com/j-tehus/hm07-qa-us/blob/8bcb5d6c7ecd50e55b54c15c272e9288631eff95/tests/putHandlers.test.js
delete https://github.com/j-tehus/hm07-qa-us/blob/8bcb5d6c7ecd50e55b54c15c272e9288631eff95/tests/deleteHandlers.test.js


The tests can be run in VS Code using the following commands:
get: npx jest getHandlers.test.js
post: npx jest postHandlers.test.js
put: npx jest putHandlers.test.js
delete: npx jest deleteHandlers.test.js
